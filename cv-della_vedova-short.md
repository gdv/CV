=====================

Gianluca Della Vedova is Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Univ.
Milano-Bicocca.
His research focuses on combinatorial algorithms in Bioinformatics, and especially on
sequence alignment, phylogeny inference, haplotyping, and alternative splicing detection.
He has also worked on graph decomposition, clustering, and data privacy.

He has an MSc (1995) and a PhD (2001) in Computer Science from Univ. of Milano.
He has taught courses dedicated to students majoring in Computer Science, Statistics,
Bioinformatics, and Data Science.

He has published more than 30 journal papers with more than 1100 citations and h-index 15
(from Google Scholar).
He has been the PI or co-PI for several projects that have been funded more than 100.000€ overall.
He is a member of the Editorial Board of "Advances in Bioinformatics" journal.
He is a member of the university committee for e-learning.
